# Decision Tree Classifier – EECS 4412 Assignment 2

This repository contains my implementation of a decision tree learning algorithm using Gini gain as the attribute selection criterion. It was developed for Assignment 2 of the Data Mining course (EECS 4412, Winter 2025) at York University.

## 🧠 Features

- Builds a decision tree from training data using Gini gain
- Handles both numerical and categorical attributes
- Supports dynamic discretization for numerical features
- Implements pre-pruning based on class purity threshold
- Implements post-pruning using reduced error pruning with validation data
- Compatible with varying datasets (flexible number of features)

## ⚙️ Implementation Details

- Language: Python
- Environment: Google Colab
- Input: CSV files for training, validation, and test sets
- Output: Predicted labels and performance evaluation

## 🧪 Files

- `A2_DT.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with full implementation
  - Contains 9 required function implementations
  - Includes provided unit tests and validations
- No external machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn) used for decision tree logic

## 🎯 Objective

To implement a fully functional decision tree learning system from scratch, reinforcing understanding of:
- Gini index and decision tree splitting
- Pre-pruning and post-pruning strategies
- Classification using learned models
